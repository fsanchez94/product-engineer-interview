# Product Engineering Interview Task

## Background
You'll be working on an e-commerce platform that processes online orders. The codebase simulates a marketplace where sellers list products and customers make purchases.

## Part 1: Customer Discount Issue

Our finance team has flagged an issue with our discount system that's impacting revenue.

**Report from Finance:**
"We're seeing some customers receiving larger discounts than intended. Some orders show 20% discounts when our maximum advertised discount is 10%. This is affecting our margins. We need to understand what's happening and fix it."

**Additional Context from Marketing:**
"We currently run a WELCOME10 promotion that gives 10% off. This promotion is featured in all our current advertising campaigns and cannot be discontinued."

**What we need from you:**
- Investigate the issue
- Identify the root cause
- Implement a solution
- Ensure your fix doesn't break existing functionality

## Part 2: Seller Intelligence Feature

Our seller success team has received feedback from merchants on our platform.

**Feedback from Sellers:**
"We're operating blind. We don't know if our prices are competitive or if we're missing opportunities. Some sellers are leaving for platforms that provide better market insights."

**Business Requirements:**
- Sellers need to understand their market position
- They want to see how their products perform relative to the market
- They need actionable insights to improve sales
- We must protect sensitive competitive information

**What we need from you:**
- Design and implement a solution
- Create the necessary API endpoint(s)
- Build the required business logic
- Document your approach and trade-offs

## Evaluation Criteria
- Understanding of existing codebase
- Product thinking and business impact consideration
- Code quality and organization
- Communication of decisions and trade-offs

## Available Tools
