# Analytics System Implementation

## Current Implementation

### API Endpoints
- `/api/sellers/{id}/analytics/` - 30-day performance metrics with seller name
- `/api/sellers/{id}/sales-performance/` - Revenue breakdown by category/product  
- `/api/sellers/{id}/market-share/` - Platform and category market share analysis

### Critical Fix: Order Status Issue

**Problem:** Analytics only included `status="paid"` orders, missing shipped/delivered revenue.

**Solution:** Updated all analytics to include `["paid", "shipped", "delivered"]` orders.

**Impact:** TechGear Pro revenue corrected from $834.95 to $3,362.38 (+303%).

## Technical Decisions

### Data Model Constraints
- Each seller has unique products (no standardized SKUs)
- Meaningful comparisons only possible at category level
- Analytics focus on category-based benchmarking vs direct product comparisons

### Architecture
```python
# Service layer pattern in analytics_service.py
def get_seller_analytics(seller_id):
    # 30-day performance snapshot

def get_seller_sales_performance(seller_id):
    # Category and product revenue breakdown
    
def get_seller_market_share(seller_id):
    # Competitive market position
```

### Privacy-Preserving Design
- Use percentiles and statistical aggregates
- Avoid exposing absolute competitor data
- Focus on seller's position relative to market

## Business Value
Sellers gain actionable insights for:
- Market positioning within categories
- Data-driven pricing decisions  
- Performance optimization opportunities
- Category expansion planning
